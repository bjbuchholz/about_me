        <li>Bio</li>
          <p>I am an East Coast transplant that fell in love with the west coast, particulary the Pacific Northwest. Having lived almost my entire life along the Atlantic Coast, I always longed for a place I could call home and that finally happended in 2004 when I relocated to Whidbey Island for my first duty staion while enlisted in the Navy.  </p><hr />
        <li>Experience</li>
          <p>My range of professional experience starts with my time spent in the U.S. Navy. Where I spent 6 years as an enlisted Naval Aircrewman aboard the P-3 Aircraft as an Inflight Aviation Electronics Technician. From there I gained valuable sales/leadersip skills over my 4 year term as a store manager with T-Mobile.</p><hr />
        <li>Education</li>
          <p>My education consist of classes taken in Green Energy efficency related to the built enviroment, to enrolling in CodeFellows and taking classes to become a full stack Javascript deveolper.</p><hr />
        <li>My Interest</li>
          <p>I enjoy anything that has to do with being outside and on the water. I enjoy the water so much so, that 5 years ago my wife and I bought a 65' retired salmon fishing boat and moved aboard. I also enjoy going to Seattle Sounders games in my spare time, and watching anything mixed martial arts related. </p><hr />
